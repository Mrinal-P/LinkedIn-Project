# LinkedIn-Project
LinkedIn is one of the most common business and employment oriented social networking websites today.
With about 467 million users worldwide and 3 million active job listings, the website is a storehouse of resources.



LinkedIn serves as the perfect platform for professionals to interact and network- be it to seek advice from industry professionals, 
looking for job opportunities in industries with a specific skill set or even to understand/ learn the top job skills required in the market. M
oreover, LinkedIn supports bridging the gap between the job-seekers and employers by the provision of job-listings with 
additional benefits of Easy-apply and Level-based jobs.



The purpose of our project is to collect the data from LinkedIn using web-scraping tools and other readily available data sources online to pull useful information. 
Further, store them in a compatible database-storage structure, here MongoDB. 
The data so collected is cleaned and standardized for making it easy to work on.



Lastly, the data is analyzed using R to draw out analyses and detect job trends. 
This is done using R-supported plots and graphs, which convey the insights of the study in a concise and complete form.
